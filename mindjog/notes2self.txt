---reeminderrrs from like coursewerk and stuff---

for now, this should work:
gcc -o test test.cpp
if anything else is needed, there's always a book or some slides to refer to


bash compile.sh




























(this only needs to happen once)
git init
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:soyiu100/farm_quest.git

-----------
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push origin master
