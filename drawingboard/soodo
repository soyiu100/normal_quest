character.cpp:
// debating whether char main will be neccessary
char main; // there can only be one main, npcs are 0
int money;
anim animals[8];
int rep;
item bag[128];

writeto.cpp:
an autosave method gets called everytime enter is hit from main
if user wants to save, they're allowed to save 3 files, saved externally, like the autosave

you can run out of animals and throw corn at the animal to knock them out, but
it will be very hard to convince your opponent of giving you anything substantial
as a reward; eg. there should be like a repuation (?) bar or something
