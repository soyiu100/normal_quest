overall structure for all cpp files:

structs
functions

that's it; no funky classes, maybe some namespaces, but don't mix classes 
and structs


mvc :
model
view
controller

also refine object creation as time goes


all characters
int money;
anim animals[8];


int rep; // only for main
item bag[128]; // only for main

messages.cpp:
-64 : splash screen


farmland.cpp: // only unique to main character
obj land[256]; // for both plants and animals 
// obj should act as a superclass for plant and animul 


writeto.cpp:
an autosave method gets called everytime enter is hit from main
if user wants to save, they're allowed to save 3 files, saved externally, like the autosave

location :
0 (/0?) - no npc
a - fight
b - spouts info or random text
c - trade a certain animal for another certain animal


there are debt collectors that will run into 0.1 miles; if you lose, you ???

you can run out of animals and throw corn at the animal to knock them out, but
it will be very hard to convince your opponent of giving you anything substantial
as a reward; eg. there should be like a repuation (?) bar or something






character.cpp: [obsolete planning]
// debating whether char main will be neccessary
// FINAL DECISION: it's not lol
char main; // there can only be one main, npcs are 0
char sex; // 0 male 1 female just for basic distinction; only for main
